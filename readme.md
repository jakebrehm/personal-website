Its sole purpose is to provide an online portfolio which combines information about me with the things I've done.

## Inspiration

I'm not exactly a web developer, so the foundation of this website is based heavily upon [Daily Tuition's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgKSqz3it50&list=PLngPGtfDZIGdKTafPdmYUpzbn37jtj9-W&index=20&t=0s) on YouTube.

I also drew a lot of inspiration from [Brittany Chiang's portfolio website](https://brittanychiang.com/). I think it looks very sleek and concise, and it was pretty much how I'd originally envisioned my website to look. That said, it has since taken a different path.

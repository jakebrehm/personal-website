Its sole purpose is to provide an online portfolio which combines information about me with the things I've done.

## Inspiration

The foundation of this website is based heavily upon [Daily Tuition's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgKSqz3it50&list=PLngPGtfDZIGdKTafPdmYUpzbn37jtj9-W&index=20&t=0s) on YouTube.

I also initially drew a lot of inspiration from [Brittany Chiang's multiple portfolio websites](https://brittanychiang.com/). That said, my portfolio has since taken a different path.

# Personal Portfolio Website

The second iteration of my personal website, built with [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) and hosted on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

Its sole purpose is to provide an online portfolio which combines information about me with the things I've done.

Check out the website [here](https://jakebrehm.com), or visit the repository of the previous iteration [here](https://www.github.com/jakebrehm/personal-website-v1).

## Inspiration

I'm not exactly a web developer, so the foundation of this website is based heavily upon [Daily Tuition's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgKSqz3it50&list=PLngPGtfDZIGdKTafPdmYUpzbn37jtj9-W&index=20&t=0s) on YouTube.

I also drew a lot of inspiration from [Brittany Chiang's portfolio website](https://brittanychiang.com/). I think it looks very sleek and concise, and it was pretty much how I'd originally envisioned my website to look. That said, it has since taken a different path.
